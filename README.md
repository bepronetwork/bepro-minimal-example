## Minimal BEPRO example

### Installation
```
$ npm install
```

### Start
```
$ npm run start
```

### Information

By building the solution on `index.js` into a bundled file with `bepro-js` via `npm run build`.    
The example spawns a page when `npm run start` is issued that will allow a user to deploy a ERC20 
Token on the `kovan` network.

You can change this limitation, by yourself, be removing or commenting the lines `59` and `60` of the
`index.js` file and providing the correct web3 provider link.

The default web3 provider is missing a _identification_ required by infura - you can use any other web3
provider that you'd like; change it on line `5` of index.js

The default base ERC20 Token is using a Kovan address, don't forget to change line `12` of index.js
if you plan on deploying on anyother network and use a ERC20 as a base on that network.

If you wish to use BEPRO token as defaults,
